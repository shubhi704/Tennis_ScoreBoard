The game is easy to explain: to win, you must score at least 4 points and win by at least 2. Yet in practice, you are supposed to use strange labels like "love" (0 points), "15" (1 point), "30" (2 points), "40" (3 points), "deuce" (3 or more points each, and the players are tied), "all" (players are tied) instead of simply tracking points as numbers, as other sports do.
